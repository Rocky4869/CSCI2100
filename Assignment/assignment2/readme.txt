Please change the file path in main.c correspondingly.

In this course, TAs use gcc compiler to compile and test your code. 
Note: This command allows you to compile multiple source files together. 
gcc main.c symtab.c -o output.out

Therefore, you do not need (actually you shouldn't) include "symtab.c" in your main.c file. Doing so will result in significant mark deduction. 

Use the following command to run the code
./output.out
